        <h2> OUR FACILITIES </h2>
    
       
            <p >
                <span class="ms-5 "> Academic facilities provide students, faculty, and researchers with the resources they need for
                learning, teaching, and research. These facilities are designed to support a wide range of educational
                activities, from classroom learning to hands-on experimentation and advanced research. Here are some of
                the key facilities commonly found in academic institutions:
<br><br>
<span class="ms-5" style="font-family:sans-serif ; text-align:center; color:teal ; ">1. Libraries: Offer access to books, journals, research papers, and digital resources. Libraries often
                include quiet study areas, computer workstations, and spaces for group study. They may also have
                archives and special collections for specialized research.<br>
            <span class="ms-5"></span>2. Laboratories: Provide hands-on experience in fields like science, engineering, technology, and
                medicine. Labs are equipped with instruments, machinery, and tools for experiments and practical work,
                such as physics labs, chemistry labs, biology labs, and computer labs.
                <br>               
                <span class="ms-5"></span>3. Classrooms and Lecture Halls: Designed for instructional use, these spaces are equipped with desks,
                projectors, whiteboards, and audio-visual systems to facilitate lectures, seminars, and interactive
                classes.<br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>4. Workshops: Allow students in engineering, manufacturing, and art-related fields to work on practical
                projects. Workshops often include equipment for woodworking, metalworking, electronics, and fabrication.
                <br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>5. Computer Labs: Equipped with computers, specialized software, and high-speed internet to support
                studentsâ€™ coursework, research, and assignments. Some labs also provide access to servers, cloud
                resources, and programming tools for IT and computer science projects.
                <br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>6. Research Centers: Specialized facilities where faculty and graduate students conduct advanced
                research. Research centers may focus on specific areas, such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology,
                environmental science, or materials science, and often collaborate with industry.
                <br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>7. Study and Collaboration Spaces: Include lounges, breakout rooms, and group study areas. These spaces
                support informal learning, group discussions, and collaborative projects.<br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>8. Auditoriums and Conference Rooms: Used for events, guest lectures, workshops, and academic
                conferences. They are usually equipped with audio-visual systems, seating for large audiences, and
                sometimes live-streaming technology.<br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>9. Innovation and Incubation Centers: Provide resources for entrepreneurship, innovation, and startup
                development. These centers often include mentoring, funding opportunities, prototyping tools, and
                networking events for students with business ideas.
                <br>
                <span class="ms-5"></span>10. Sports and Recreation Facilities: Help students maintain a healthy balance between academics and
                physical well-being. Facilities can include gyms, sports fields, swimming pools, and courts for sports
                like basketball, tennis, and football.<br>
